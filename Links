```The final stages of penetration testing involve setting up persistence and covering our tracks. For today's material, we'll detail the later as this is not mentioned nearly enough.

During a pentesting engagement, you will want to try to avoid detection from the administrators & engineers of your client wherever within the permitted scope of the pentesting engagement. Activities such as logging in, authentication and uploading/downloading files are logged by services and the system itself.

On Debian and Ubuntu, the majority of these are left within the "/var/log directory and often require administrative privileges to read and modify. Some log files of interest:

"/var/log/auth.log" (Attempted logins for SSH, changes too or logging in as system users:)
"/var/log/syslog" (System events such as firewall alerts:)
"/var/log/<service/"```
